    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p></p> A simple and basic recipe that gives anyone longing for New York's famous pizza something to truly enjoy! 
    Add some flavor to your dough by incorporating seasonings such as oregano or garlic powder (1/2 teaspoon of each is more than enough). 
    The dough can also be frozen for longer storage.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water</li>
        <li>½ cup bread flour</li>
        <li>1(.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li> 3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, 1/2 cup flour, yeast, 
        and sugar in a bowl; stir well and let sit until mixture is foamy and bubbling, 
        about 20 minutes.
        </li> 
        
        <li>Stir 2 cups flour, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt into yeast mixture using 
        a wooden spoon until dough holds together; turn onto a lightly floured work surface.
        </li>
        
        <li>Coat the inside of a large bowl with 2 1/2 teaspoons olive oil.</li>

        <li>Knead dough, adding small amounts of flour as needed, until soft 
        and slightly sticky, about 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Form dough into a ball and place in the prepared bowl; drizzle about 
        1/2 teaspoon olive oil over dough and spread to coat entire ball. 
        Cover bowl with a clean kitchen towel and place in a warm area of 
        the kitchen until dough is doubled in size, about 2 hours.</li>

        <li>Punch dough down and place in a large resealable plastic bag; 
        refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. When ready to use, remove dough 
        from refrigerator and bring to room temperature before using.</li>
